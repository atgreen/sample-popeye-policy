# This is a k8s sanitizer policy file.

# This file provides json pattern matchers for every "expected fail"
# (XFAIL).  The policy engine will essentially ignore any failures in
# a popeye report that match these patterns.

# Ignore level 1 and 2 findings.  We only care about the really bad
# stuff.  The '..' notation indicates a range of values.
{ "report": "popeye", "level": "1..2" }

# Ignore platform issues until next year.
